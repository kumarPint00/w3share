2. Choose between **"Quick Gift"** or **"Custom Gift"**

#### Step 2: Select Assets
1. **View your assets** - See all your ERC20 tokens and NFTs
2. **Choose what to gift** - Click on tokens or NFTs to select them
3. **Set amounts** - Enter how much of each token to send

#### Step 3: Add Personalization

3. **Create secret code** - This protects your gift

#### Step 4: Review and Lock

2. **Confirm transaction** - Approve in MetaMask
3. **Wait for confirmation** - Your gift is now locked on blockchain!

#### Step 5: Share Your Gift

3. **Track status** - Monitor if your gift gets claimed

## 📋 Gift Creation Options

### Quick Gift (Recommended for beginners)

### Best Practices

2. **Check your balance** - Tokens/NFTs should appear
3. **Transaction complete** - You're done!

### What Happens During Claim
